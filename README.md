# Gopi Chandran | Biotechnology • Bioinformatics • Operations

MPS Biotechnology student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), with a B.Tech. in Biotechnology from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). Interests include biotechnology R&D, reproducible bioinformatics, mammalian cell culture operations, and biotechnology commercialization.

> **Portfolio integrity note:** The code examples in this repository are reproducible demonstrations and workflow templates. They do not claim to reproduce proprietary employer work or unpublished research results. Replace example inputs with authorized data before using these workflows for research. Never upload confidential, patient-identifiable, employer-owned, or otherwise restricted data.

## Areas of focus
- **Bioinformatics:** RNA-seq workflow design, transcriptome analysis, functional annotation, comparative genomics, biological databases.
- **Biopharmaceutical operations:** laboratory readiness, mammalian cell culture, documentation, process consistency, and quality-conscious work.
- **Commercialization and coordination:** partner screening, competitive intelligence, market landscape analysis, project coordination, and scientific communication.
- **Computing:** Python, R, Linux, MySQL, and selected bioinformatics tools.

## Selected work

### 1. RiceStressDB — agricultural biotechnology database
A database project organizing rice stress gene-expression information.
- Organized 1,200+ genes across 17 biotic and abiotic stress conditions.
- Integrated functional annotations and stress metadata.
- MySQL and PHP.
- Government of India copyright registration reported as SW-35001/2025-CO.

The repository currently includes a **demonstration SQL schema and sample records**, not the original production database.

### 2. RNA-seq workflow template
A small, reproducible Python quality-control summary workflow is included under `workflows/rnaseq/`. It operates on a clearly labelled example count matrix and generates summary tables and a plot. It is **not** a replacement for raw-read QC, alignment, differential-expression analysis, or functional annotation. The README in that folder explains the next steps for a full HISAT2/StringTie-based pipeline.

### 3. Quality and process monitoring demonstration
A Python example under `workflows/quality_control/` demonstrates descriptive process monitoring using synthetic measurements. It illustrates how to calculate summary statistics, flag observations outside illustrative limits, and document assumptions. The example is educational, **not a validated QC method or a GMP release test**.

### 4. Research background
- *Moringa oleifera* RNA-seq transcript profiling: tools used included HISAT2, StringTie, TransDecoder, eggNOG-mapper, and InterProScan. Reported project metrics: 79.79 Mb assembly size, N50 2,094 bp, and 66,079 transcripts >200 bp.
- Bamboo comparative genomics: research internship at Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun.
- Pivot Bio commercialization strategy: assessed market opportunity, competitive positioning, target customers, value proposition, go-to-market strategy, and exit considerations. The team received the highest simulated investment allocation ($1 million) among five finalist teams.

## Experience highlights
### Regenova Pharmaceuticals — Business Development and Operations Management Intern
- Screened 20+ potential industry and academic partners; five advanced to the next evaluation stage.
- Prepared market landscape and competitive-intelligence materials across biotherapeutics, AI-enabled drug discovery, oncology, and infectious diseases.
- Translated scientific programmes into partnership, proposal, commercialization, and funding materials.

### UMBC — Graduate Assistant / Teaching Assistant
- Supported coordination across 13+ biotechnology and life-science courses.
- Helped coordinate 100+ class sessions and 60+ guest speakers.
- Laboratory experience includes HEK293 and HTB-182 cell culture, internally modified laboratory protocols, CO₂ incubators, biosafety cabinets, microscopy, and automated/manual cell counting, as applicable to work performed.
- Contributed literature review and preliminary investigation to a xenotransplantation-related project examining flow-cytometry approaches for chimerism detection.

## Technical toolkit
**Bioinformatics:** HISAT2, StringTie, TransDecoder, eggNOG-mapper, InterProScan, BLAST, MEGA, KEGG  
**Data:** Python, R, Linux, MySQL, PHP  
**Biotechnology:** Mammalian cell culture, molecular biology, genomics, RNA-seq, functional annotation  
**Operations:** Documentation, project coordination, stakeholder communication, market research, competitive intelligence

## Education
- **MPS Biotechnology**, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) — expected May 2027
- **B.Tech. Biotechnology**, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) — GPA 3.70/4.00

## Run the examples locally
See each workflow folder for commands and limitations. Python examples require Python 3.10+ and packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
